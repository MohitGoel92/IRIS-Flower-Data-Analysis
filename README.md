# IRIS Flower Data Analysis

## Task: Flower Classification

We are tasked to produce a machine learning model that classifies flowers. We have been given a dataset with 4 variables that are used to classify the flowers, but for graphical representation of the predictive regions it is ideal to produce a model with 2 variables. We will therefore be using "Dimensionality Reduction", alongside "K-Fold Cross Validation" and "Grid Search" for model evaluation and parameter tuning in order to find the optimal model. 

We will be classifying the flowers using Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and XGBoost to find the optimal model.
